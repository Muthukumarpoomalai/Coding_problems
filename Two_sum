## Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

---

## Python Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        seen = {}
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            complement = target - num
            if complement in seen:
                return [seen[complement], i]
            seen[num] = i

```
